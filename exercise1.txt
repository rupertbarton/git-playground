This is a story, all about how my Gran thinks I'm a massive disappointment. 
Mostly because I didn't finish my rap about the fresh sandwich from Dot bagel, but also because I am the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.
I ate Lewis' bagel, I was the one that did it. No-one else. Every night it eats me away, I haven't slept in days.
If you find this then they got me, spare me a prayer and may god rest my soul.
